This was one of the first tracks that I started on my M8. I used some samples from "Club Fantastic Party Tools Vol. 1" sample pack (link below). I had originally planned on writing lyrics & recording vocals for it - and I still might eventually - but in the meantime, I decided to map our the vocal parts with a square wave and turn it into a chiptune track.
