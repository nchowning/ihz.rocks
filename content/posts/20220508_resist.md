I started writing this track right after I got my M8. I had on made the droning bass and percussion. I was going for something with a gritty, pseudo-chip metal kind of sound. I just couldn't figure out where to go with it from there. This week, I added some melodies and solidified a chord progression. I'm pretty happy with how it turned out.

The title "Resist" came from a couple of things. When I listen to this song, I picture the future in the Terminator universe where Skynet has taken over and the humans refuse to be beaten. Also, the impending blow to the freedom of women in the United States has been on my mind a lot.

I was originally thinking of "Resistance is not futile" for the title but a friend of mine suggested just "Resist" and I liked that better. Thanks [Ben](https://twitter.com/_bseb_)!
